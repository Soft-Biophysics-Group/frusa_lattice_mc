## Default model library -- two state system 

This library is used as a default option in case no `<MODEL_TYPE>` flag is\
provided.

### Description of the system
The system consists of $N$ particles, which may be in one of two states with\
corresponding energies $\pm\Delta/2$.
The parameters of the model are

* $N$ - number of particles
* $\Delta$ - energy gap
* $T$ - temperature of the system
